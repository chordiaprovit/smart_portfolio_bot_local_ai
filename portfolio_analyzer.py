    {description}

    Please analyze the portfolio and respond using markdown bullets.

    For each point, limit your response to 1â€“2 lines:
    1. Show sector allocation as percentages.
    2. Give a brief risk assessment (focus on diversification and sector exposure).

    Also suggest improvement with few tickers to balance the portfolio better (e.g., diversify sector or reduce overlap).
